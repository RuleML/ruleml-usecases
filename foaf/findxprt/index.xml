		<header>Overview</header>
		<p>The Semantic Web contributes to making AI mainstream. AI knowledge
representations such as ontologies and rules can be used to formalize
Web metadata vocabularies, where constants, classes, and relations
carry URIs. This permits AI reasoning over metadata both for direct
question answering and high-precision information (URI) retrieval.
In parallel, the Web 2.0 has been developed with social networking
portals as a main component. The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) project
uses Semantic Web metadata for social networking: The FOAF vocabulary
defines classes and properties (binary relations) for describing
profiles of persons and organizations, where a 'knows' property
establishes the social network. While current FOAF profiles group
ontology-defined class and property facts around persons, this talk
proposes to also allow person-centric rules. In particular, a Horn
rule can derive a new property (e.g., how to contact John) from a
conjunction of given properties (e.g., the relationship between John
and the caller, their urgency, John's location, and the time of day). 
We propose rules also for creating new connections between persons.
Expert finding is considered as a special case of social networking
where the ontology and rules define areas and degrees of expertise
as well as the availability of an expert for a user. When an expert
is not available, their 'knows' property can be used for (possibly
recursive) referrals to other experts. Our FindXpRT system implements
these methods in a <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/foaf">RuleML-extended FOAF</a>.
We propose a benchmark suite for expertise exchange more generally,
testing expert-finding systems against expert profiles. This is
exemplified with our implemented system, tested against expertise
and co-expertise areas in computer science and music, respectively.

		<p>The FindXpRT system -- its theory and implementation -- is described in detail in the documents below.
		Meanwhile, improvements of the underlying <a href="http://www.jdrew.org/oojdrew">OO jDREW</a> engine led to a 160-fold speed-up of the numbers published in the benchmarks there.</p>
